    """
    Deconvolve an image with the point spread function

    Perform image deconvolution on an image with the instrument
    point spread function using the my algorithm published in ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : 'numpy 2d array'
        An image.
    psf : `~numpy.ndarray
        The point spread function. 
    iterations: `int`
        Maximum number of iterations
    tolerance: 'float'
        The image deconvolution stops when the maximum change from all pixels between the simulated observed image and the observed image is less than TOLERANCE counts.
    mask: 1d array or 2d array
        Allows to select an image subregion for which the convolution is done. By that, the algorithm can massively speeds up. Can be either a 1d array containing the four elements [left, bottom, right, top], or a 2d array masking the pixels that shall be deconvolved. Actually, if the 2d mask is used, from that the boundaries of the 1d array will be calculated, i.e., all pixels in a corresponding rectangualar box will be deconvolved.
        At the moment, the dimensions of mask has to be smaller than half of the dimensions of the image. If you need to deconvolve a larger region, deconvolve the entire image instead.
    estimate_background: True/False
        If a subregion deconvolution is used, it determines if an incoming scattered light estimate from the surrounding region to the subregion should be applied. This increases the fidelity of the result, but costs some computation time. Generally, it is required for average image intensities and below, but is not required for deconvolving bright image regions.
    use_gpu: True/False
        If True, the deconvolution will be performed on the GPU.
    pad: True/False
        If true, increase the size of both the psf and the image by a factor of two, and pad the psf and image accordingly with zeros. As this is a fourier-based method, this breaks the symmetric boundary conditions involved in the fourier transform.
    large_psf: True/False
        Usually, the PSF has the same dimension as the image, restricting scattered light to half of the image size. If set to true, the PSF given to the deconvolution has to be double the image size (that allows scattering over the full image range). The image will be padded with zeros to match the size of the full psf, and deconvolution is done over the full psf.
